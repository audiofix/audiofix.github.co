    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>We are all capable of so much more – at work and at home. Coaching helps us get closer to the answers and achieve things we previously might not have thought possible. It helps unlock our potential.</p>

    <p>For the last four years, I have been working as a Coach both in house and privately.</p>

    <p>I have over 30 years’ experience in Advertising, Production, and Learning & Development and now I’m bringing that experience into my role as a full-time Coach to unlock my potential!</p>

    <p>Successful coaching leads the person being coached to identify for themselves the specific actions they are going to take to help them make progress. And when any of us create our own solutions, then we own them and are far more likely to act on them. It’s so much better than simply being told what to do!</p>

    <p>On a personal level, I love to work with anyone who’s reaching out for something that they can’t quite get hold of, whatever that might be, either in their personal or work lives.</p>

    <p>In business, I’m experienced working at all levels, from new managers to Executive Coaching at Board level, with a focus on supporting and guiding middle management in their growth and development.</p>

    <p>You can review my CV <a href=http://localhost:4000/downloads/AlanMeadCV.pdf target="_blank">here</a> – it will tell you a bit more about my work history and experience. You can also find me on <a href="https://www.associationforcoaching.com/members/public_profile.asp?id=56172754" target="_blank">The Association for Coaching’s website</a></p>

    <p>I'm proud to be recognised by various Coaching qualifications and certification bodies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Coaching Organisation Coaching Practitioner Certificate <em><a href=http://localhost:4000/certifications/CoachingPractitionerCertificate.jpeg target="_blank">View certification</a></em></li>
      <li>The NLP Training Company NLP Practitioner Certificate</li>
      <li>CIPD Foundation Certificate in Organisational Coaching (Distinction) <em><a href=http://localhost:4000/certifications/CIPDCoachingDistinctionCertificate.jpeg target="_blank">View certification</a></em></li>
      <li>CIPD Foundation Course for Trainers <em><a href=http://localhost:4000/certifications/CIPDTrainersCertificate.jpeg target="_blank">View certification</a></em></li>
      <li>ILM Foundation Leadership Programme Certificate <em><a href=http://localhost:4000/certifications/ILMManagementCourseCertificate.jpeg target="_blank">View certification</a></em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>My Training experience is probably best summed up by my time working at Advertising Agency Bray Leino, where I produced the submissions that won the business the prestigious Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA) Continuous Professional Development (CPD) Gold Award in 2015, 2016 and 2017 and IPA CPD Platinum Award in 2016 and 2017. These illustrated how the Training Programmes I designed and implemented in each year directly contributed to the Agency achieving its annual business objectives and targets.</p>

    <p>Outside of work, I love to travel. I have enjoyed fantastic family trips to Australia and New Zealand in recent years and most recently, we visited Jersey and France in our VW camper van.</p>

    <p>I love music too, especially live, both watching and playing (the bass guitar, badly, in various local pub bands over the years) and photographing live bands too.</p>

        My sessions with Alan helped me to realise what I really wanted out of my career and where my strengths lie. He understood how I ticked and helped build my confidence no end and for that I’m forever in his debt. I would highly recommend Alan.
